This was going to be my "year in review" post, but I only have about 15 minutes to post this or I'll break my first new year's resolution on Day 1! Instead, I thought I would quickly write down the resolutions I've been thinking about. Lord knows I'm terrible at these, but maybe putting them out on the public web will hold me accountable (I have my doubts).

# 1\. Write more. 

This is obviously something I do as a part of my job, but academic writing rarely reaches the larger public. Works of public musicology and music theory have been popping up a lot lately, and that kind of writing is something that I think is important. I also think that writing reguarly on my blog will probably help my writing overall, so here's my resolution: 

- Write a blog post every day for the month of January
- Write a blog post at least once a month for the remainder of the year

# 2\. Browse less.

I thought about deactivating my Facebook account again, but I chickened out. Jillian will tell you that my worst habit is browsing Facebook and Twitter on my phone. While I still find Twitter to be useful (and highly entertaining), I find Facebook to rarely be anything but a vapid timesuck. I'm going to delete Facebook from my phone for the next 30 days and see how it goes. Hopefully I don't miss it. 

# 3\. Listen to more music. 

This seems ridiculous, since I essentially listen to music for a living. I have a longer post on this in the works, but essentially, I think streaming services (Spotify and Youtube) have dampened the love for the discovery and enjoyment of new (to me) music. We got a new amplifier and turntable for Christmas, which I think will help with this. 

# 4\. Play more music.

This is another ridiculous one, given my job, but so much of my everyday life gets tied up in research and teaching that I don't often find time to play music purely for enjoyment. I want to spend at least 30 minutes a day hacking through something at the piano or guitar, or even get the trumpet out once in a while. 

That's it. Let's see how this goes. Here's to a great 2017! (We can't get much worse than 2016, can we?)
