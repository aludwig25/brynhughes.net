There is some irritating commercial (maybe an Apple commercial?) that uses a catchy pop tune that includes the lyrics "work work work work work" over and over again. After seeing the commercial for the thousandth time, I finally googled the lyrics and discovered the song is called "Work From Home" by Simon Cowell's frankengroup Fifth Harmony.[^1] The song features an unchanging bouncy synth groove throughout, with the song's sections defined solely by melodic and lyrical content. And hoo-boy, that lyrical content is something else. What follows are my "quasi real-time" reactions to the song upon first listen.[^2]

**Verse 1**

> I ain't worried 'bout nothin' <br>
I ain't wearin' na nada <br>
I'm sittin' pretty, impatient, but I know you gotta <br>
Put in them hours, I'mma make it harder <br>
I'm sending pic after picture, I'mma get you fired

Our protagonist is lonely, sitting at home, and pining for her boyfriend. She knows that he has to work hard to earn a living, but sends him naughty pictures nonetheless, hoping to encourage eager anticipation of some sexy time, presumably at some point in the near future. 

**Pre-Chorus**

> I know you're always on the night shift <br>
But I can't stand these nights alone <br>

We know, lady, you're really lonely. 

> And I don't need no explanation <br>

OK, wait, is she actually this guy's boss? This sounds like she's reprimanding him. 

> 'Cause baby, you're the boss at home <br>

'Cause he does all the work ... IN BED! Apparently she's dating Andrew Dice Clay. 

**Chorus**

> You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work 

OK, now she's giving him the day off? She's definitely his boss, and this is some kind of torrid workplace romance.

> But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work

She sounds like a hockey coach, here. 

> You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work

This guy must be really confused at this point. His boss keeps telling him he has to go to work, and then immediately telling him he has the day off. 

> Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work <br>
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh

It's nice when companies let their employees telecommute. Good for the environment, too.

**Verse 2**

This is where things get weird. As I [discussed yesterday](/post/2017-01-02-teenage-dream-toddler-imposed-nightmare), I'm pretty sure most pop songwriters don't give a shit about the second verse. 

> Let's put it into motion <br>
I'mma give you a promotion 

More empty corporate promises, if you ask me. Let's get this in writing before we move any further. 

> I'll make it feel like a vacay, turn the bed into an ocean

I appreciate the sexy sentiment, here, but this sounds messy. 

> We don't need nobody, I just need your body

This is starting to sound like a failed script for another [*Species* sequel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_(film)#Sequels). 

> Nothin' but sheets in between us, ain't no getting off early

Sheets *in between us*? Now I'm *definitely* convinced this woman is an alien. 

**Rap Verse by Ty Dolla $ign!**

> Girl, go to work for me <br>

Wait, wait, wait. So, obviously Ty is the overworked boyfriend, but now I'm confused. Is he going into business for himself? Why would he tell his boss that? 

> Can you make it clap, no hands for me? <br>
Take it to the ground, pick it up for me <br>
Look back at it all over me <br>
Put in work like my timesheet <br>
She ride it like a '63 <br>
I'mma buy her no Celine <br>
Let her ride in a foreign with me <br>
Oh, she the bae, I'm her boo <br>
And she down to break the rules <br>
Ride or die, she gon' go <br>
I won't judge, she finesse <br>
I pipe up, she take that <br>
Putting overtime on your body <br>

Lot's of great stuff in here. My particular favourites are "I'mma buy her no Celine." You're right, Ty, a Celine Dion record is decidedly un-sexy. Don't do that. Also, the when he says "she the bae" I thought he said "shit the bed", which makes the above-mentioned ocean metaphor a little more disturbing. 

**Conclusion**

This song is great.
