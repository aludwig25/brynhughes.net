Last week I taught my final classes at the University of Miami. Two exams and a few papers to grade, and then we can focus completely on our big move to Lethbridge. Most of the big things have been taken care of: the movers have been hired, the flights have been booked. In a week I will be heading west to find a place to live for our family. I think once we've acquired a place to live, this will all start to feel a little more real.
